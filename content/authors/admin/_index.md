My dissertation addresses the democratic and representational implications of party and interest group competition in primary elections. Using a combination of methods, including a conjoint survey experiment, case studies, and original longitudinal campaign finance data, the dissertation demonstrates that growing voter distrust of parties and political institutions combined with significant changes to the campaign finance system have benefited candidates who, in previous eras, have been blocked or impeded from running for office by party leaders.

My research has appeared in [Party Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1354068819834528) and in [Leadership in the U.S. Senate: Herding Cats in the Modern Era](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-U-S-Senate-Herding-Modern/dp/113806839X). I have also written for [Mischiefs of Faction](https://www.vox.com/mischiefs-of-faction/2018/10/8/17950046/citizens-united-interest-groups), [LegBranch.org](https://www.legbranch.org/interest-groups-are-out-performing-the-parties-in-congressional-primaries/), and the [Princeton University](http://blog.press.princeton.edu/2016/08/05/pennsylvania-senate-election-2016-pragmatism-and-intraparty-conflict/) [Press Blog.](http://blog.press.princeton.edu/2016/08/24/nevada-senate-election-2016-money-and-the-shadows-of-party/)

I received my B.A. in Political Science from Central Connecticut State University, and my M.A. in Political Science from Brown University. Prior to attending graduate school I worked as a legislative operations specialist for the Connecticut General Assembly. When I am not reading or thinking about politics I enjoy trying new restaurants, rooting for the Boston Red Sox and New York Giants (it's a Connecticut thing), and walking my two dogs.
